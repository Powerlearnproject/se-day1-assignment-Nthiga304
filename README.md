-  Businesses across all sectors rely on software to automate processes, analyze data, and enhance customer experience.

  

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
i) The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
The term software engineering was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the software crisis—a period when software systems became increasingly complex and unreliable.
ii) The Rise of Structured Programming (1970s-1980s)
With growing complexity in software development, structured programming emerged as a methodology that improved code readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
iii) The Agile Manifesto (2001)
The Agile Manifesto, introduced by software development experts, revolutionized software engineering by emphasizing iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexibility over rigid planning. Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) replaced traditional waterfall models, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software faster and more adaptively in response to changing requirements.



**List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.**
i) Planning – Involves defining project goals, scope, budget, and feasibility. This phase ensures alignment with business needs and risk assessment.
ii) Requirements Analysis – Stakeholders and developers gather and document functional and non-functional requirements to define what the software must accomplish.
iii) Design – Architects and developers create system architecture, data models, and interface designs, ensuring scalability, security, and efficiency.
iv) Implementation (Coding) – Developers write code based on design specifications, using programming languages and frameworks suited for the project.
v) Testing – Quality assurance teams perform unit, integration, and system testing to detect and fix bugs, ensuring the software functions correctly.
vi) Deployment – The software is released to users in a live environment, either in phases (incremental rollout) or all at once (big bang deployment).
vii) Maintenance and Support – Developers provide updates, fix bugs, and enhance functionality based on user feedback and evolving requirements.



**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
i) Approach:	Waterfall is linear and sequential while Agile is iterative and incremental
ii) Flexibility: 	Waterfall  is rigid, changes are difficult while Agile is highly flexible, adaptable
iii) Documentation:		Waterfall  requires extensive documentation before development	while Agile requires minimal documentation, focuses on working software
iv) Testing:	For Waterfall it is done after implementation	while for Agile continuous testing throughout development is key
v) Customer Involvement:	Limited to initial planning and final delivery for Waterfall and Continuous feedback and collaboration for Agile

Waterfall is best for projects with well-defined requirements and minimal expected changes, such as:
- Large government contracts (e.g., military software)
- Infrastructure projects (e.g., banking systems)
- Safety-critical applications (e.g., medical devices)

Agile is ideal for projects requiring flexibility and frequent updates, such as:
- Mobile app development
- SaaS (Software as a Service) products
- Startups experimenting with new features



**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
i) Software Developer
- Designs, writes, and maintains code based on project requirements.
- Debugs and fixes issues in the software.
- Collaborates with other developers, designers, and stakeholders.
- Ensures the software follows best practices and coding standards.

ii) Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
- Designs and executes test plans to identify bugs and issues.
- Conducts manual and automated testing to ensure software quality.
- Works with developers to ensure defects are fixed before deployment.
- Ensures the software meets performance, security, and usability standards.

iii) Project Manager (PM)
- Oversees the entire software development process.
- Plans and allocates resources, ensuring timely delivery.
- Communicates with stakeholders to define project goals and requirements.
- Manages risks, tracks progress, and ensures team collaboration.



**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
i) IDEs streamline software development by providing a comprehensive set of tools in a single interface, improving efficiency and reducing errors.
Key Benefits:
- Code editing with syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
- Debugging tools to identify and fix errors.
- Build automation and testing integration.
- Code navigation and refactoring support.

Examples include:
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Lightweight and extensible, widely used for web and cloud development.
- JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA – Optimized for Java and Kotlin development.
- Eclipse – Popular for Java and enterprise applications.

ii) VCS enables developers to track changes, collaborate efficiently, and maintain different versions of code without conflicts.
Key Benefits:
- Allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously.
- Maintains a history of changes, enabling rollback to previous versions.
- Facilitates code reviews and collaboration through branching and merging.

Examples include:
- Git – The most widely used VCS, often paired with GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
- Subversion (SVN) – Centralized VCS used in enterprise environments.
- Mercurial – Similar to Git but designed for simplicity and scalability.



**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
i) As projects grow, maintaining and understanding large codebases becomes difficult.
**Solution**: Use modular programming, adhere to design patterns, and document code effectively. Tools like IDEs and code linters help maintain structure and readability. 

ii) Identifying and fixing bugs can be time-consuming.
**Solution**: Adopt systematic debugging techniques, use logging and monitoring tools (e.g., LogRocket, Sentry), and write unit tests to catch errors early.
Keeping Up with Rapidly Evolving Technologies

iii) The software industry evolves quickly, requiring continuous learning.
**Solution**: Follow tech blogs, take online courses, contribute to open-source projects, and attend developer conferences.
Meeting Tight Deadlines

iv) Software engineers often work under time constraints, leading to stress and rushed development.
**Solution**: Use Agile methodologies (e.g., Scrum, Kanban) for better time management, prioritize tasks effectively, and communicate roadblocks early.
Ensuring Software Security

v) Applications are vulnerable to cyber threats like SQL injection, XSS, and data breaches.
**Solution**: Follow secure coding practices, conduct security audits, and use frameworks with built-in security features.
Effective Collaboration in a Team

vi) Miscommunication and lack of coordination can slow down development.
**Solution**: Use collaboration tools (e.g., Jira, Slack, Git), conduct regular stand-up meetings, and adopt clear coding standards.
Handling Version Control Conflicts

vii) Merging code changes in a team environment can lead to conflicts.
**Solution**: Use feature branches, commit frequently, and follow best practices in Git (e.g., rebase instead of merge when necessary).



**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
i) Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation.
- Purpose: Ensures each unit (e.g., function, class, or module) works correctly.
- Example: Testing a login function to verify that it correctly validates user credentials.
- Importance: Catches bugs early, making debugging easier and reducing overall development costs.

ii) Integration Testing: Tests the interaction between multiple units or modules to ensure they work together as expected.

- Importance: Confirms that the final product is user-friendly, functional, and meets stakeholder expectations.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input prompts to optimize the responses generated by AI models. It involves structuring queries in a way that guides the AI to produce accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.
- Well-structured prompts improve AI accuracy and relevance, reducing vague or incorrect answers.
- Clear prompts minimize trial-and-error, making interactions with AI more effective and time-efficient.
- Custom prompts can tailor AI responses for applications such as content creation, programming, and data analysis.
- Thoughtfully crafted prompts help mitigate misinterpretations and biases in AI-generated responses.
- In machine learning, prompt engineering helps refine model outputs without needing extensive retraining.



**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
Vague Prompt: Tell me about technology.
Improved Prompt: Provide a brief overview of the impact of artificial intelligence on modern healthcare, including examples of its applications.
The Improved Prompt is More Effective since it is:
- More specific narrowing the focus to artificial intelligence in healthcare.
- Clear expectations with an "overview" and specifies that "examples" should be included.
- Concise and direct eliminateing ambiguity, ensuring the AI provides relevant and structured information.
